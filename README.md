# Mei's SteamVR Null-Flipper

Are you also someone who uses the Null-driver for SteamVR a lot, but also likes to just... play VR games?`
Do you also find swapping in and out of the configurations is a bit of a hassle?
Well, do I have the script for you?

This very simple Batch-script will create backups of your existing configs, and then modify them to activate the Null driver in SteamVR.
It casn then quickly swap back and forth between the originals and the modified ones.

That's it really! I just wanted a script to handle this and figured I might as well share it.

Enjoy!
